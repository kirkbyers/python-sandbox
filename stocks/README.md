## Work in progress

Most of this comes from a [youtube tutorial series](https://youtu.be/URTZ2jKCgBc?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDd0flgGphKCej-9jp-QdzZ3). I'm aiming to modularize the completed tutorial and refactor the code for more reusability. After, I'll be adding my own usage to find new insights, and demonstrate understanding.
